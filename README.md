### ⚠️ Notice! - Dhis is only tested with servers that use libpandadna like Toontown Stride 

# ❓ What is DNA Tools
DNA Tools is a modification of libpandadna to bundle all third party dependencies and not worrying about your python version.

This app is great for people to compile their DNAs in the libpandadna architecture. It requires no install and all you have to do is clone the repo to get it running.

This app comes bundled with ply and the correct python binary and a noob proof batch script to run the Converter.

# 🖍 Usage

## 💻 Windows
To use this tool simply drag the .DNA files ontop of the **Drag DNA Here.bat** file to convert them.

This tool accept multiple .DNA files at once


## 🐧 Linux

```bash
python2 compile.py <DNA File>
```
